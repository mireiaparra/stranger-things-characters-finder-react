# Stranger Things characters search engine (React)
This is my Stranger Things project built with React, HTML & Sass. Here you'll find more about it and how to use it.

## Description

This project is a web page with a list of Stranger Thing characters. You can filter them by name, gender or residence. You can also sort them by name, relevance or the number of episodes in which they appear. 

## How to use it
* **See the characters.** You'll be able to see a list of Stranger Things characters. They're returned from a third-party API. 
* **Filter by name.** There is the possibility to filter characters by name. You only need to write in the "Busca un personaje" field and you'll see if there's any matching character according to your search. 
* **Filter by gender.** You can also filter the characters by gender. There you'll find three options: all, which is the default one and shows all the characters, male or female. You only need to click in the option you want and you'll see the result.
* **Filter by residence.** You'll see many checkboxes which correspond to the residence of each shown character. You can click as many as you want and you'll get all the characters that match the checked residences.
* **Sort.** The characters are sort by relevance by default. You can change that selecting another option in the "Relevancia" field. You'll be able to sort them by relevance, name or appearance, which is the number of episodes in which the characters are in.
* **Reset.** Did you have fun filtering and sorting characters, but now you are a bit tired about it? No problem, you can always click the Reset button and all the options will be changed to their default one. 
* **Character detail.** Don't forget to click on your favorite character. You'll see more information about them!
